Do you want to build a beautiful website to share your documentation or project guide? Maybe you're a developer or writer who wants a space online to organize your ideas. Well, meet **Docusaurus**, a tool that helps you do just that, and it's super friendly for beginners.

In this guide, I’ll show you step-by-step how to use Docusaurus from scratch using simple language. Even if this is your first attempt, you’ll be able to follow along.


## What Is Docusaurus?

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a tool made by Facebook (now Meta). It helps people create websites for documentation. These websites are fast, pretty, and easy to use.

Think of it like this. If your documentation is a book, Docusaurus is the bookshelf that displays it neatly.


## Docusaurus Themes: Choosing the Right Starter

When you create a new Docusaurus project, you need to choose a **theme**. A theme is a set of pre-built pages and layouts that give your documentation site structure and style.

For this tutorial, we’ll use the **classic** theme. It comes with everything you need: a docs section, a blog section, a homepage, and a sidebar. This is the best theme for beginners.

Other available [themes](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/themes) include:

* **@docusaurus/theme-live-codeblock**: Adds support for live-editable code blocks.
* **@docusaurus/theme-search-algolia**: Adds search powered by Algolia.
* **@docusaurus/theme-redocusaurus**: Integrates OpenAPI documentation.
* **@docusaurus/preset-openapi**: Good for API documentation sites.

Each theme gives your site different powers. You can explore these based on your needs.

## How to Know Which Docusaurus Theme You’re Using

To find out which theme you’re using, follow these steps:

1. **Open your project folder.**
2. Look for the file named `docusaurus.config.js`.
3. Inside that file, scroll down until you find a section that looks like this:

```js
presets: [
  [
    'classic',
    {
      docs: {
        // config options here
      },
      blog: {
        // config options here
      },
      theme: {
        customCss: require.resolve('./src/css/custom.css'),
      },
    },
  ],
],
```

The word `'classic'` means you're using the **Classic theme**.

If you're using another theme or plugin-based layout, it may show something else like:

```js
presets: [
  '@docusaurus/preset-openapi', // for API reference sites
]
```

This tells you which design and features are enabled in your Docusaurus project.


## What You Need Before Starting

Before we begin, make sure you have these:

* A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
* Internet connection
* Node.js installed (version 16.14 or later)
* Git installed (to track your work and collaborate)
* Yarn or npm

### Install Git and Node.js

If you don't already have them:

[Download Git](https://git-scm.com)

[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

To check versions:

```bash
node -v
git --version
yarn -v (optional)
```

> If `yarn` is not installed and you prefer it over `npm`, run:
>
> ```bash
> npm install -g yarn
> ```


## Create a New Docusaurus Project

There are two options here. You can use **npm** or **yarn**.

### Option 1: Using npm

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-docs-site classic
```

### Option 2: Using yarn (faster if npm fails)

```bash
yarn create docusaurus my-docs-site classic
```

Both commands do the same thing:

* `my-docs-site` is the name of the folder.
* `classic` is the theme preset.

You’ll be asked:

* What language? Choose `JavaScript` for now.


## Go Into Your New Project

```bash
cd my-docs-site
```

Install dependencies (if not auto-installed):

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```


## Start the Development Server

This shows your site in the browser:

```bash
npm run start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

Your site should open at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```


## Understand the Project Structure

Here’s what’s inside your new project:

* `docs/`: Markdown files for your documentation.
* `blog/`: Markdown files for your blog posts.
* `src/pages/`: Custom pages like "About" or "Contact".
* `static/`: Static assets like images or favicons.
* `docusaurus.config.js`: Main configuration for your site.
* `sidebars.js`: Controls the navigation sidebar.
* `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.


## Configuration Files Explained

### docusaurus.config.js

This file controls your entire site.

Important fields:

```js
const config = {
  title: 'My Docs Site',
  tagline: 'Learn fast. Build smart.',
  url: 'https://yoursite.com',
  baseUrl: '/',
  favicon: 'img/favicon.ico',

  themeConfig: {
    navbar: {
      title: 'Docs Site',
      items: [
        { to: '/docs/intro', label: 'Docs', position: 'left' },
        { to: '/blog', label: 'Blog', position: 'left' },
        { href: 'https://github.com/your-org', label: 'GitHub', position: 'right' },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

You can change the title, links, logo, theme, and even add Google Analytics or search here.

### sidebars.js

This file helps organize your sidebar menu. If you want Docusaurus to create it automatically:

```js
const sidebars = {
  tutorialSidebar: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.' }],
};
```

That tells Docusaurus: “Scan the `docs/` folder and build the sidebar based on what you find.”


## Add Your First Doc Page

1. Go to the `docs/` folder.
2. Create a new file called `hello.md`
3. Add this:

```markdown
---
id: hello
title: Hello, Docusaurus!
---

Welcome to your first Docusaurus doc page.
```

> ⚠️ The section at the top (between the triple dashes) is called **Frontmatter**.
>
> It tells Docusaurus important info like the `id`, `title`, and where the page fits. It's also useful for SEO because it helps search engines understand your page content better.

Now visit:

```
http://localhost:3000/docs/hello
```


## Customize the Homepage

1. Open `src/pages/index.js`
2. Change the heading and subtitle:

```js
<Heading as="h1">Welcome to My Docs Site</Heading>
<p>Your go-to place for guides and tutorials.</p>
```

3. Update the call-to-action button:

```js
<Link to="/docs/hello">Get Started</Link>
```


## Add a Blog Post

1. Go to `blog/`
2. Create `first-post.md`

```markdown
---
title: My First Blog Post
description: Sharing my documentation journey.
date: 2025-08-01
---

Hello everyone! This is my first blog post on Docusaurus.
```

Visit:

```
http://localhost:3000/blog
```


## Build Your Site

When you're ready to go live:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

It creates a `build/` folder with all the static files ready to upload.


## Deploy Your Site (Optional)

You can publish your site using:

* GitHub Pages
* Netlify
* Vercel

Follow Docusaurus [deployment guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment) to choose your preferred host.
