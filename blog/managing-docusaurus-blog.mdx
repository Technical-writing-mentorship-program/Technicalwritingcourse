So you've built a basic Docusaurus site. Now you want to take it further. Maybe turn it into a real community blog. You want contributions. You want author images and bios to show. You want tags and categories to make your content searchable.

Let’s make it happen. This guide will walk you through managing a Docusaurus blog, enabling public contributions, and structuring your content in a maintainable way, all using VS Code.
### Initial Setup

First, make sure you have Node.js and Git installed. Then, scaffold your Docusaurus site:

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-blog classic
cd my-blog
npm install
npm start
```

This creates a classic Docusaurus setup with a blog included by default.


### Folder Structure Explained

In the `my-blog` project folder, note the following structure:

```
my-blog/
├── blog/
│   ├── my-first-post.md
│   ├── another-post.md
├── blog-authors.yml
├── src/
│   └── pages
├── docusaurus.config.js
```

* **blog/**: This contains all blog articles written in Markdown.
* **blog-authors.yml**: This YAML file defines contributors.
* **docusaurus.config.js**: Central configuration file for the whole site.


### Adding a Blog Post**

To add a new post, create a new markdown file in the `blog/` folder:

```bash
advanced-docusaurus-blog.md
```

Inside the markdown file, start with front matter:

```markdown
---
title: "Managing Docusaurus Blog for Contributors"
authors:
  - samuelbenson
tags: [docusaurus, blog, contribution]
---

This is an example article.
```

### 4. Set Up Author Metadata with `authors.yml`

To manage contributor information without repeating details in every markdown file, you can create an `authors.yml` file inside the blog folder.

This method allows you to reference authors using a `key` in your blog markdown file.

**Why use `key`?**

The `key` acts as a unique identifier that pulls the author's name, picture, and title from `authors.yml`. This keeps your blog files clean and easy to maintain.

#### Folder structure:

```
my-docusaurus-site/
├── blog/
│   ├── my-first-blog-post.md
│   ├── another-post.md
│   └── authors.yml
```

#### Sample `authors.yml`:

```yaml
samyben:
  name: Samuel Benson
  title: Technical Writer
  url: https://github.com/Samuel-Benso
  image_url: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12345678?v=4

janedoe:
  name: Jane Doe
  title: DevOps Engineer
  url: https://janedoe.dev
  image_url: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87654321?v=4
```

> You can copy your GitHub profile image link by opening your GitHub profile, right-clicking the avatar, and selecting “Copy Image Address.”

#### Sample blog markdown:

```md
---
slug: my-first-blog
title: My First Blog Post
authors: [samyben]
tags: [introduction, docusaurus]
---

Welcome to my blog post written in Markdown. This was contributed by Samuel.
```

If you want to add multiple contributors:

```md
authors: [samyben, janedoe]
```

This setup will automatically display their names, roles, and profile pictures at the end of the post.


### Understanding the blog frontmatter

Each blog post starts with frontmatter. Here's a breakdown:

```markdown
---
title: "How to Contribute to the Blog"
description: "Guide for new contributors to our Docusaurus blog."
authors:
  - samuelbenson
tags: [contribution, docusaurus, writing]
keywords: [Docusaurus, blog, contribution]
---
```

**Explanation:**

* **title**: Post title.
* **description**: Short snippet shown in previews.
* **authors**: Keys from `blog-authors.yml`. Use an array if there are multiple authors.
* **tags**: Help group content by category.
* **keywords**: Improve SEO.


### Using tags.yaml for Tag Definitions

Create `tags.yaml` in the root (blog) folder:

```yaml
docusaurus:
  label: Docusaurus
  description: Posts about Docusaurus blog and site management.

contribution:
  label: Contribution
  description: Posts focused on helping contributors write.
```

#### What `tags.yml` Does in Docusaurus

In a Docusaurus blog, `tags.yml` is used to **define metadata** about blog post tags. Each tag in your blog (e.g. `#Beginner`, `#DevTools`, `#API`) can have more descriptive information such as a label, description, and permalink.


#### Where It’s Found

You’ll typically find it here:

```
/blog/tags.yml
```


#### Example `tags.yml` File:

```yaml
beginner:
  label: Beginner
  permalink: /blog/tags/beginner
  description: Posts suitable for beginners in technical writing or documentation.

vscode:
  label: VS Code
  permalink: /blog/tags/vscode
  description: Posts related to Visual Studio Code setup, extensions, and usage.

docusaurus:
  label: Docusaurus
  permalink: /blog/tags/docusaurus
  description: Tips and tutorials related to Docusaurus usage and configuration.
```

#### Why It’s Important

* It ensures **tag pages are well-structured** and user-friendly.
* Helps with **SEO**: Each tag can have a unique URL and description.
* Makes your blog **more navigable**: Tags show up as clickable filters in your blog UI.


#### How to Use

When you write your frontmatter and assign it tags like this:

```md
tags: [beginner, vscode]
```

Docusaurus will look in `tags.yml` to display the tag label, description, and link it to a proper `/tags/{tag}` page.


### Running Locally with VS Code

In VS Code:

1. Open the folder.
2. Use the integrated terminal to run:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Your site will be live at `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Modify files in real-time and see changes.


### Enable GitHub Contributions

To allow external contributions:

* Push your Docusaurus repo to GitHub.
* Create a `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` file explaining how to add posts.
* Example:

```markdown
## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch
3. Add your blog post in `/blog`
4. Update `blog-authors.yml` with your info
5. Commit and push
6. Open a pull request
```


### Common Issues and Fixes

* **Issue:** Author image not loading

* **Fix:** Make sure the `image_url` is a direct image link (ends in `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.)

* **Issue:** Post not showing

* **Fix:** Ensure the date in filename is valid and frontmatter is correct

* **Issue:** Contributor name not appearing

* **Fix:** The key in frontmatter must match the key in `blog-authors.yml`


### Final Checklist

* [x] Blog file named with date
* [x] Frontmatter has `authors`, `title`, `tags`
* [x] Author key is defined in `blog-authors.yml`
* [x] Images are correctly linked
* [x] Blog appears on `/blog`


### Conclusion

With Docusaurus and VS Code, you can create a flexible, open-source blog platform for multiple contributors. Managing posts, defining authors, using GitHub for collaboration, and organizing your blog for clarity will position your documentation site for long-term success. Happy documenting!
