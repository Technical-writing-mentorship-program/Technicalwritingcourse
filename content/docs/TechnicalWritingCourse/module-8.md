Editing is a vital aspect of the technical writing process. It gives technical document accuracy, consistency, clarity, and better user comprehension. With editing, you check for organization, navigation, paragraph structure, style, tone, and overall content.

Everyone can coin a write-up, but what makes a valuable document is its conciseness and correctness, edited to fit all required criteria (Such as style, tone, audience needs, and so on).

Robert Cormier says - “The beautiful part of writing is that you don't have to get it right the first time, unlike, say, a brain surgeon. You can always do it better; find the exact word, the apt phrase, the leaping simile." Editing is the other layer of work that makes your technical documentation better.

### Proofreading

Proofreading focuses on finding and correcting errors within writing, grammar, tense, language, typography, spelling, and punctuation.
It is carefully examining your work for any remaining mistakes.

With proofreading, it is important to slowly and carefully read through your work.

**_An in-depth look at how proofreading works in the context of technical documentation:_**

##### Identifying and Correcting Typos:

One primary objective of proofreading is to catch and correct typographical errors or "typos" in the document. It includes instances where you omit or duplicate letters or words. Proofreading goes through the document to spot and rectify such mistakes.

##### Checking for Spelling Errors:

Spelling errors are common in technical documentation and undermine the credibility of the content. Proofreading carefully reviews the document to identify and rectify any misspelled words. It includes common words and industry-specific terminology.

##### Correcting Grammatical Mistakes:

Proofreading involves the correction of grammatical errors. It includes issues such as, subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, pronoun-antecedent agreement, and sentence structure. Proper grammar is essential for clear and effective communication.

##### Addressing Punctuation Issues:

Correct punctuation gives clarity to technical documentation. Proofreading ensures punctuation marks such as commas, semicolons, colons, and periods work correctly. They also check for consistent formatting with quotation marks, parentheses, and other special characters.

##### Cross-Referencing and Hyperlinks:

You have cross-references and hyperlinks to related sections or external resources. Proofreading reviews these elements to ensure they are accurate and functional. Broken links or incorrect references disrupt the reader experience and undermine the document's reliability.

##### Formatting and Layout:

Proofreading pays attention to the document's formatting and layout, including issues like line spacing, margins, and alignment. They ensure the document is visually appealing and adheres to any formatting guidelines.

##### Consistency in Abbreviations and Acronyms:

Proofreading verifies that abbreviations are consistently applied throughout the document and are defined or explained upon first use.

**_Example of proofreading;_**

```
Original:

The studnet's preformance on the experiment was exceelent, demnstrating a thorough understandng of the scientific methode.
```

```
Proofread Version:

The student's performance in the experiment was excellent, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the scientific method.
```

{{< callout context="tip" title="Notice how (student's), (excellent), and (demostrating) were wrongly spelt in the orginal." icon="rocket" >}}
{{< /callout >}}

It's important to note that proofreading needs a keen eye for detail, a strong command of language, and a thorough understanding of the subject matter. While proofreading can enhance the overall quality of technical documentation by eliminating surface-level errors, it is just the first step in the editing process.

Subsequent editing stages, such as copy and substantive editing, focus on more comprehensive aspects of the document, such as content clarity, style, and overall structure.

### Copy Editing

Copy editing involves shaping the technical documentation. It ensures factual and stylistic consistency across the technical document, improves readability, improves sentence flow, and corrects tone inconsistencies. Copy editing is a factor that makes sure a piece of writing is accurate, clear, and correct.

Copy editing ensures the document adheres to a specific style guide, maintains a consistent voice, and presents technical information in a manner that is accessible and engaging for the target audience.

**_How copy editing works in technical documentation:_**

##### Style and Consistency:

Copy editing enforces a consistent style throughout the document. It includes ensuring elements such as headings, subheadings, font styles, and formatting adhere to a predefined style guide (industry standard or organizational guideline).

##### Tone and Voice:

Copy editing focuses on maintaining a consistent tone and voice throughout the document. It ensures the documentation tone aligns with the audience expectations. The tone is more formal and informative for technical documentation but may need to be adjusted to fit the specific audience.

##### Eliminating Redundancy:

Redundant information clutter technical documentation. Esther Freud says - “Editing is everything. Cut until you can cut no more." Copy editing helps you trim excesses and refine your work to its essential components. You identify and eliminate unnecessary repetition or redundant content to ensure the document is concise.

##### Conciseness and Efficiency:

Copy editing makes documentation more concise by removing wordiness and unnecessary tenses. Concise writing is essential for maintaining readers interest and conveying information efficiently.

##### Sentence and Paragraph Structure:

Copy editing evaluates sentences and paragraph structure to ensure information logically flows. It may reorganize paragraphs or suggest changes in the sentence structure to enhance the overall coherence of the document.

##### Visual Elements:

Copy editing reviews visual elements such as tables, figures, diagrams, and captions to ensure correct labeling, format, and reference within the text. It also checks if visual elements are consistent with the overall style of the document.

##### References and Citations:

If the document includes references, citations, or footnotes, copy editing verifies their accuracy and consistency with the chosen citation style, such as APA, MLA, or a specific industry standard.

**_Example of copy editing;_**

```
Original:

The company's marketing strategy is good. They aim to reach a wide audience and their products are superior than others in the market.
```

```
Copy Edited Version:

The company's marketing strategy is effective. They aim to reach a broad audience, and their products are superior to others in the market.
```

{{< callout context="tip" title="Notice how copy editing fixed the sentence structure and the tone/voice." icon="rocket" >}}
{{< /callout >}}

Copy editing ensures the document conveys accurate technical information clearly, concisely, and engagingly, enhancing its usability and effectiveness.

### Substantive Editing

Substantive editing is a more in-depth and comprehensive stage of the editing process. It involves shaping the consistency, cohesiveness, and conciseness of technical documentation.

With consistency, substantive editing ensures that information presented in diverse parts of the document does not contradict each other. Take the example of having “producer” and “manufacturer” in the same document.

With cohesiveness, it ensures information flows logically. You can use a where you may have:

| logical arrangement | alphabetical arrangement |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Start               | Accelerate               |
| Accelerate          | Brake                    |
| Brake               | Start                    |
| Stop                | Stop                     |

Substantive editing checks the intended use, organization, flow, and content strength. You can also check if too much or too little information is present and if similar information is presented consistently across documentation. But it is always better to use less information. Thomas Jefferson says - “The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do."

**_How substantive editing works in technical documentation:_**

##### Content Evaluation:

It evaluates the overall documentation content to ensure it aligns with the documentation purpose and target audience. It assesses whether the content is relevant, accurate, and comprehensive.

##### Structural Reorganization:

It involves reorganizing the document's structure for optimal clarity. You suggest changes to the order of sections, headings, and subheadings to ensure a logical flow of information. This restructuring makes complex technical concepts more accessible to readers.

##### Content Expansion or Reduction:

Depending on the documentation purpose, substantive editing may recommend adding more detailed explanations or examples for better clarity. Conversely, it might require condensing overly thorough content to maintain conciseness while preserving essential information.

##### Tone and Voice Adjustment:

It fine-tunes the documentation tone and voice. It ensures the content is better pitched (for end-users, technical experts, or other stakeholders). The adjustment helps maintain the readers engagement.

##### Enhancing Clarity:

It makes the technical content clear, rephrases sentences, simplifies complex language, and provides concise simplification for technical terms and concepts. The goal is to ensure readers with limited technical knowledge grasp the information.

##### Fact-Checking and Accuracy:

It pays meticulous attention to the accuracy of the information presented. Substantive editing verifies data, statistics, references, and technical details to ensure they are up-to-date and accurate. The fact-checking is essential for maintaining the documentation’s credibility.

##### Consistency in Terminology:

It confirms that terminology and technical jargon work consistently throughout the documentation. It may create a glossary to define all technical terms and ensure the definition or explanation of the terms upon first use.

##### Cross-Referencing and Citations:

It checks the accuracy and consistency of cross-references, citations, and footnotes. Substantive editing ensures correct formatting of all references according to the chosen citation style, such as APA, MLA, or a specific industry standard.

##### Visual Elements:

Substantive editing reviews and suggests improvements to visual elements, such as tables, figures, diagrams, and captions. It confirms if these elements enhance the content's clarity and integrate effectively into the text.

##### Usability and Accessibility:

It considers the usability and accessibility of the document. It includes assessing its navigational aids, such as headings, bulleted lists, and links, to ensure readers easily find information. Ensuring better accessibility of the document to individuals with disabilities in compliance with relevant accessibility standards.

**_Example of substantive editing;_**

```
Original:

In this report, we discuss various aspects of climate change. The first section is about causes, the second is about effects, and the third is about solutions.
```

```
Substantive Edited Version:

This report comprehensively explores climate change, covering its causes, effects, and potential solutions in three distinct sections.
```

## Editing Technical Documentation for Clarity, Conciseness, and Correctness (Accuracy)

<!-- ![How to editing](/assets/images/How-to-editing-CCC.jpg) -->

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xykfc692ilw3uf886sdu.jpg" alt="Image description" width="400" height="500">

Editing for clarity, conciseness, and correctness is a standard for producing credible and quality technical documentation. The section details how to edit technical documentation with the 3Cs.

### Clarity

Clarity refers to the quality of being clear, transparent, and easily understood. It involves expressing ideas, information, or instructions in a way that is easy for the audience to comprehend. A clear message is free from ambiguity, confusion, or unnecessary complexity.Editing for clarity ensures easy understanding for its target audience.

**_How to edit for clarity:_**

##### Understand Your Audience:

Before you begin the editing process, clearly understand your target audience. Are you writing for technical experts, beginners, or a mixed audience? Knowing your audience knowledge level, interests, and expectations is the first step in editing for clarity.

##### Simplify Technical Jargon:

Technical documentation often contains specialized terminology and jargon unfamiliar to non-experts. Edit by explaining technical terms and consider using simpler synonyms. Clarity helps you strike a balance between technical accuracy and accessibility.

##### Organization and Structure:

Review the organization and structure of the document. Ensure the logical presentation of information. Headings and subheadings help readers navigate through the content. Group related information and use a clear hierarchy to show the relationships between sections.

##### Consistency:

Consistency in terminology, style, and formatting is essential for clarity. Ensure the consistent use of the same terms throughout the documentation. Formatting elements such as fonts, headings, and lists should follow a uniform style.

##### Active Voice:

Active voice sentences are more direct and easier to understand. Passive voice may make sentences more complex and less clear. Editing for clarity ensures the use of active voice in your sentences.

##### Avoid Ambiguity:

Ambiguity can lead to confusion. Review your content for ambiguous terms, phrases, or sentences. Be explicit in your explanations, and avoid leaving room for multiple interpretations. If there's room for misunderstanding, clarify.

##### Visual Aids:

Consider using visual aids like diagrams, charts, and illustrations. These help clarify complex concepts and make the content more accessible. Ensure proper labeling of visual aids and integration into the text.

##### Examples and Analogies:

Provide real-world examples and analogies to explain technical concepts. Analogies bridge the knowledge gap and make abstract or complex ideas more relatable.

##### Revision and Iteration:

Editing for clarity is an iterative process. After making initial edits, revisit the document multiple times to refine and enhance its clarity. Each revision brings the content closer to your clarity goals.

```
Original:

The new software update has implemented changes to the user interface, providing users with a more seamless and user-friendly experience.
```

```
Clarity Edit:

The latest software update has improved the user interface, making it more seamless and user-friendly.
```

{{< callout context="tip" title="Notice how clarity edit gave better understanding and easy readability to the text." icon="rocket" >}}
{{< /callout >}}

By applying these principles and techniques, you can effectively edit technical documentation for clarity, making it more accessible and understandable for your intended readers, regardless of their level of technical expertise. Clarity in technical documentation is vital to its usability and effectiveness.

### Conciseness

Conciseness refers to the quality of expressing ideas in a precise manner without unnecessary elaboration or redundancy. Concise technical documentation conveys information using the most efficient/effective language, avoiding unnecessary words or details that do not contribute to the main message.

Editing for conciseness is also an essential aspect of creating better technical documentation. A concise document is more engaging, easier to read, and communicates information more efficiently.

**_How to edit for conciseness:_**

##### Identify Redundant Information:

Review your document to identify redundant content. Check for repeated information, ideas, and unnecessary phrases and eliminate redundancy to make the document more concise.

##### Remove Unnecessary Words:

Carefully examine each sentence and paragraph to identify and remove unnecessary words. Examples include filler words, redundant adjectives, and overly complex sentence structures. Simplify sentences to convey the same meaning with fewer words.

##### Avoid Wordiness:

Check for wordy phrases you can shorten without losing meaning. For example, replace

- "due to the fact that" with "because"
- "in order to" with "to."

Reducing wordiness is a quick way to increase conciseness.

##### Use Active Voice:

Passive voice sentences are wordier than active voice sentences. Rewrite passive voice sentences to make them active. It shortens sentences and makes them more direct and engaging.

##### Cut Down on Qualifiers:

Qualifying words and phrases like "very," "extremely," "quite," and "somewhat" can often be eliminated without affecting the meaning of a sentence. Reducing qualifiers leads to more concise and assertive statements.

##### Condense Lists:

Lists may become lengthy and cumbersome. Edit lists to be more concise by

- Removing unnecessary items,
- Combining related items,
- Presenting the information in a more organized format, such as a table or chart.

##### Use Abbreviations and Acronyms Judiciously:

Abbreviations and acronyms help reduce the length of technical terms. However, carefully use them and ensure it suits your target audience. Always spell out the full term on first time and include the abbreviation in parentheses. An example is the Technical Writing Mentorship Program (TWMP).

##### Focus on Key Information:

Prioritize the most critical information and eliminate less vital details. Your documentation should deliver the essential information without overwhelming the reader.

##### Use Bullet Points and Headings:

Bullet points and headings can break up dense paragraphs and provide concise, organized information. Use them to present key points and create a visually appealing document.

**_Example of editing for conciseness;_**

```
Original:

It is important to note that the primary reason for the increase in sales is due to the fact that our marketing strategies have been highly effective.
```

```
Conciseness Edit:

The increase in sales is primarily due to our highly effective marketing strategies.
```

{{< callout context="tip" title="Notice how concise edit eliminated unnecessary words/information and made the content more direct. to the text." icon="rocket" >}}
{{< /callout >}}

Editing for conciseness is a better balance between preserving essential information and removing unnecessary content. A concise document saves the writer and the reader time and enhances the documentation overall readability and impact.

### Correctness (Accuracy)

Correctness refers to the quality or state of being accurate, free from errors, and following established standards, rules, or facts. In technical documentation, correctness is a measure of accuracy and appropriateness.

Editing for correctness is another critical aspect of technical documentation. Ensuring the information in your documentation is precise and error-free is essential to maintain the credibility of the content.

**_How to edit for correctness:_**

##### Fact-Checking:

Verify the accuracy of data, statistics, references, and any technical details. Ensure the information is up-to-date and consistent with current knowledge and industry standards.

##### Cross-Reference Sources:

If your document cites external sources or references, cross-reference these sources to confirm the accuracy of the information. Check that citations are correctly formatted and lead to the intended source.

##### Check Technical Details:

Pay close attention to technical details. Double-check codes, calculations, formulas, and specific measurements to ensure accuracy. Even minor errors in technical details have significant consequences.

##### Grammar and Syntax:

Accurate grammar and syntax are essential for clear and precise communication. Review the document for grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and sentence structure. Incorrect grammar can lead to misunderstandings.

##### Check Spelling and Typographical Errors:

Even a single typographical error casts doubt on the accuracy of your document. Proofread the document carefully to catch spelling mistakes and typographical errors. Spelling errors can change the meaning of a word or term, leading to confusion.

Maintaining accuracy in technical documentation is paramount, as errors lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, or potentially dangerous consequences. Thoroughly editing for accuracy helps ensure your document is a reliable and trustworthy source of information.
